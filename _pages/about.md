I am a Professor of [Mathematics](https://www.cmich.edu/colleges/se/math/Pages/default.aspx) at [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu).  Since August 2019, I have also served as Department Chair.  My research interests lie in [algebraic combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_combinatorics) and [representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory); primarily in the theory of [crystal bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_base).

Prior to coming to Central Michigan University, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Institute of Computational and Experimental Mathematics](https://icerm.brown.edu) at Brown University during the thematic semester entitled "[Automorphic Forms, Combinatorial Representation Theory and Multiple Dirichlet Series](https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s13/)", where my postdoctoral mentor was [Anne Schilling](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/) from [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu).
In Fall 2013, I held a postdoctoral fellowship from [The City College of New York](https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu), where my mentor was [Gautam Chinta](https://chinta.ccny.cuny.edu).
In 2012, I earned by Ph.D. in Mathematics at the [University of Connecticut](https://math.uconn.edu) under the direction of [Kyu-Hwan Lee]({{ site.links.KHL }}).
