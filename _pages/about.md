I am a second-year PhD student at ENS-PSL at the Computational Bioimaging and Bioinformatics group advised by [Auguste Genovesio] (http://www.ibens.ens.fr/?rubrique47). I work on **multimodal learning** in High Content Screening and deep learning applications in **Image based drug discovery**.  
I also work as a research scientist at [Synsight] (https://synsight.net/).

Previously, I obtained my [M.Sc. Applied Mathematics] (https://www.master-mva.com/) from ENS Paris Saclay where I wrote my thesis with [Virginie Uhlmann] (https://www.virginieuhlmann.com/).
